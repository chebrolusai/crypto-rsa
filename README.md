# About

- ### Prime Numbers

  The algorithm begins with generating a private key and a public key. For this to happen, it requires two <b>Prime Numbers</b>.

  1. It generates two random numbers between 4-5 digits
  2. It looks for the closest prime numbers from the random numbers
  3. A Miller-Rabin primality test is performed on the given number. The test works well for large prime numbers compared to the traditional approach and is not compute intensive.

  <b>Note:</b> _Miller-Rabin primality is a probabilistic test that tells whether a number is likely prime. This test is not deterministic and there couble be a very small probability of error._

- ### Public and Private keys

  Using the prime numbers, the program then generates a modulus <b>N</b> and the Euler's Totient. The larger the prime numbers, the harder they are to crack.

  1. It then finds and selects a co-prime number using GCD ( greatest common divisor )
  2. The encryption key E has the following properties

     - _1 < E < EULER_TOTIENT_
     - Co-prime with EULER_TOTIENT and N

  3. The decryption key D is found using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

  4. These keys are then stored into the files <b> public_key.rsa </b> and <b> private_key.rsa </b>
